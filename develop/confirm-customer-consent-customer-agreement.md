# Confirm customer acceptance of Microsoft Customer Agreement

**Applies to:**

- Partner Center

Partner Center currently supports confirmation of customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement only in the *Microsoft public cloud*. This functionality doesn't currently apply to:

- Partner Center operated by 21Vianet
- Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany
- Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

This article describes how to confirm or re-confirm customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

## Prerequisites

- If you are using the Partner Center .NET SDK, version 1.14 or newer is required.

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](./partner-center-authentication.md). *This scenario only supports App+User authentication.*

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard). Select **CSP** from the Partner Center menu, followed by **Customers**. Select the customer from the customer list, then select **Account**. On the customerâ€™s Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

- The date (**dateAgreed**) when the customer accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

- Information about the user from the customer organization that accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement. This includes:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Email address
  - Phone number (optional)

## .NET

To confirm or re-confirm customer acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement:

1. Retrieve the agreement metadata for the Microsoft Customer Agreement. You must obtain the **templateId** of the Microsoft Customer Agreement. For more details, see [Get agreement metadata for Microsoft Customer Agreement](get-customer-agreement-metadata.md).

   ```csharp
   // IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

   string agreementType = "MicrosoftCustomerAgreement";

   var microsoftCustomerAgreementDetails = partnerOperations.AgreementDetails.ByAgreementType(agreementType).Get().Items.Single();
   ```

2. Create a new **Agreement** object containing details of the confirmation.

3. Use the **IAgreggatePartner.Customers** collection and call the **ById** method with the specified **customer-tenant-id**.

4. Use the **Agreements** property, followed by calling **Create** or **CreateAsync**.

   ```csharp
   // string selectedCustomerId;

   var agreementToCreate = new Agreement
   {
       DateAgreed = DateTime.UtcNow,
       TemplateId = microsoftCustomerAgreementDetails.TemplateId,
       PrimaryContact = new Contact
       {
           FirstName = "Tania",
           LastName = "Carr",
           Email = "someone@example.com",
           PhoneNumber = "1234567890"
       }
   };

   Agreement agreement = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Agreements.Create(agreementToCreate);
   ```

A complete sample can be found in the [CreateCustomerAgreement](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples/blob/master/Source/Partner%20Center%20SDK%20Samples/Agreements/CreateCustomerAgreement.cs) class from the [console test app](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples) project.
