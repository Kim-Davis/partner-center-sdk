## Quality control checklist (for Microsoft contributors)

- [ ] 1. **Acrolinx:** Make sure your Acrolinx score is **above 80 minimum**, but higher is better, and **0 spelling issues**. Acrolinx helps us in English, but also helps our system ensure translation to localized languages is possible.

- [ ] 2. **Successful build with no warnings and no suggestions**: Review the build status to make sure **all files are green** (Succeeded).

- [ ] 3. **Preview the pages**: Click each **Preview URL** link to view the rendered HTML pages on the review.docs.microsoft.com site to check the formatting and alignment of the page. Scan the page for overall formatting, and look at the parts you edited in detail.

- [ ] 4. **#Sign-off**: Once the pull request is finalized and ready to be merged, indicate so by typing `#sign-off` in a new comment in the Pull Request. If you need to cancel that sign off, type `#hold-off` instead. Signing off means the document is ready for review, and can be published at any time. 


## Merge and publish
- After you sign off, there is a separate PR Review team that will review the PR and describe any necessary feedback before merging. 
- They use the comments in the PR on the GitHub site to provide feedback if changes are needed. Make any adjustments and sign off again to request another review.
- Once all feedback is resolved, the PR Review team will merge the pull request into master branch. 
- From the master branch, the work is merged into the live branch twice a day to publish it to the public docs.microsoft.com site.
- The docs site publishes automatically twice a day - 9am and 3pm Pacific time.
